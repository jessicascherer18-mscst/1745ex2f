<h3>The Organic Experience</h3>
<p><span class="dropcap">A</span>ll of our juices and smoothies are made 
from organic herbs, fruits and vegetables. We use a combination of fresh 
and frozen ingredients, and buy locally whenever possible. You will 
never get processed or refined foods, sugars, or spices in one of our 
juices. We are committed to making business choices that support a 
sustainable environment, including using recycled materials in all of 
our paper products, composting, and using solar energy as our primary 
power source. </p>
<h3>Drink to your health!</h3>
<p><span class="dropcap">O</span>ur menu changes daily to reflect the 
ingredients we have on hand. Donâ€™t see what you want? Create your own 
combination, or ask for a recommendation. All juices are made fresh to 
order. Juices make great breakfasts, snacks, or for post-workout 
replenishment, and are a great way to get in your daily intake of five 
fruits and vegetables.</p>
